# RWAPPER (Router Wrapper)
Small library that I created to allow for quick swapping out of various HTTP routers.

The main benefit of this is to avoid changing much else that some corner case routing paths in an application. The goal of the RouterWrapper interface
is to allow compatability with the default http library in go.
